- **HTML5 mobile interface for Waartaa**

  Implement a mobile optimized client for Waartaa. This will basically be
  a web app which can run on mobile browser, Firefox OS, as a native app (
  using Phonegap) as well. Some major differences of the mobile web app from
  the desktop web app will be:

  - **Less subscriptions to data**. Subscribe for data elements which need to
    be rendered in the UI.
  - **On demand loading of data**. This will take some time, but it will be
    memory savvy.

- **Build APIs, bots for seamless 3rd party integration**

  Integration with 3rd party services like Bugzilla, git (and other VCS), trac,
  etc. have always existed in the IRC world, using bots. However, there are
  some common steps involved:

  - Write code for the bot, if someone hasn't already done it
  - Run the bot in a server
  - Monitor and maintain it

  We want to make this process simpler by allowing one click setup of a channel
  bot with optional integration to 3rd party services supported by Waartaa. We
  also need to come up with a friendly API to empower the community to
  integrate a new service with Waartaa.

- **Enable scaling Waartaa**

  Currently, Waartaa is made to run on a single server only. We need to
  separate the layers: application, IRC, etc. and run them as different
  processes in the same or different machines. This will help us to have
  NxM combination of application and IRC servers, and will help us balance
  the load on Waartaa. Also, optimization will be needed at the database layer
  to handle increased writes and reads.

- **Improve on audio/video communication integration done during GSoC**

  It's in our tasklist to do a basic integration of audio/video communication
  using WebRTC during GSoC 2014. However, we need to revisit this feature
  and improve it to make it usable by loads of users of Waartaa.

- **Easy setup and deployment**

  Write scripts, and package Waartaa for easy setup and deployment of Waartaa.

- **Distributed log storage**

  Allow users to share space from their cloud storage (Dropbox, Google drive,
  etc.) where Waartaa can dump their logs into small files. The data from these
  files can be viewed from Waartaa from the log browser. This distributed 
  storage model will allow Waartaa service providers to operate with less
  server storage without compromising on the realtime nature of Waartaa. It
  will not be easy for users to search through all logs at once, but Waartaa
  will put its best efforts to perform as much as possible in limited resources
  too.

- **Encrypt private user logs**

  Give the user option to for encrypted storage of private chat logs in the
  server. This will come with some trade off for servr side search in the
  encrypted logs. But, this is a price one may be willing to pay for privacy.
  Waartaa aims at providing options to the user to take ownership of their
  data.

- **Secure authentication with IRC servers**

  IRC servers do authentication with raw text passwords. That's why, we do not
  store NickServ passwords in Waartaa at this moment. However, it's not at all
  user friendly to authenticate manually to IRC servers everytime a user joins
  a server. Waartaa needs to figure out a way to store user passwords in a safe
  way so that admins of the Waartaa service don't have a way to pick into
  user's IRC passwords from the database or the system.

- **Wizard to help new users get started**

  One of the shortcoming with the current IRC tools is that they require some
  learning curve to get started with. People who come to IRC thinking it to
  be just another chatting client are often confused. They don't know where
  to go and how to talk nicely on IRC.

  So, we plan to implement a wizard for new users to guide them to proper IRC
  channels based on their area of interest. Initially, this will be only for
  popular open source project. We'll keep a very simple way for the community
  to add content for the wizard. This is inspired by
  `http://www.whatcanidoformozilla.org/ <http://www.whatcanidoformozilla.org/>`_.

- **API to export logs**

  An API to export chat logs. Using this API, convertors can be built for
  chat logs to make it compatible with the popular IRC clients.

- **Friend finder**

  It's more natural to communicate with friends on Google Hangout, Facebook
  Chat, etc. rather than find a nick in an IRC channel. Waartaa wants to add
  a personal touch to IRC, if the user desires so. A user will be allowed to
  follow (identified) channel nicks. If the other nick is also using Waartaa,
  he/she can choose to follow the follower as well. That's how two users become
  friends on Waartaa. Users will be able to see a list of people they follow
  who are online and can directly initiate chat with them irrespective of
  an IRC server or channel.

- **Improve UX**

  - *keyboard shortcuts for navigation*

    Many people love to use the keyboard for UI navigation. Inspired by the
    'Ctrl + p' (or 'Cmd + p') keyboard shortcut in SublimeText, we'd like to
    implement a similar feature (along with other necessary keyboard shortcuts)
    to provide a quick and easy way to navigate through the UI of Waartaa.

  - *customizable color schemes*

    IRC users spend a significant amount of time on IRC. So, if text editors
    like vim, emacs, sublime text has the option of color themes, then why
    should not an IRC client. Waartaa plans to implement various color themes
    to soothe the eyes for long working hours. Adding a color theme will be
    quick and simple: a few CSS rules. A user should be able to apply a custom
    theme from the client side itself, without requiring any server change.

  - *In page integration with paste services like gist, pastebin, etc.*

    IRC ettiquetes include that anybody should not paste multiple lines
    into the channel. It is considered spamming. So most of the people
    resort to pastebin/Github gist to sort out the problem. At Waartaa, we
    want to give the user an option to upload a file or scrible some text
    or code in an in page text editor (powered by Ace text editor), and Waartaa
    will upload the data to some public paste services like pastebin, Github
    gist, etc. and send the link generated as a chat message. This will save a
    significant amount of time for the user.

  - *UI endpoint for most IRC (server) actions*

    Waartaa aims to provide UI endpoints for various common IRC actions like
    becoming operator, releasing operator status, kicking or banning a nick,
    editing channel topic message, etc.

  - *Autocomplete IRC (server) commands, along with commands cheatlist*
