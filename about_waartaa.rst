What is Waartaa?
================
Waartaa is an open source IRC client as a service, for a start. It aims to
become a one stop communication and collaboration tool for teams. Waartaa,
i.e., **Wārtā** is a word in Hindi: **वार्ता**, which means
**to communicate**. This is what Waartaa is aimed at.


Why Waartaa?
============
Waartaa took birth out of sheer necessity and due to a prevalent disatisfaction
with the existing IRC clients. Although, open source organizations tend to
stick to IRC, smaller teams and startups started moving to other communication
tools (e.g., Hipchat). I can think of some reasons for this migration:

- No setup (SAAS)
- Better clients:

  - always in sync
  - accessible from multiple devices
- Better notification
- Plethora of pre built plug-n-play plugins
- Other communication modes: audio, video

With Waartaa, we are trying to solve the above issues around IRC and more. We
believe that IRC is great for text communication. By building better tools
around IRC, we can really play an important role in shaping up the future of
open source communication and collaboration tools.


Current status
==============
Waartaa is still in it's early days. We work on Waartaa after (or before)
office hours and on weekends. Despite of the odds, we now have a proof of
concept. Following is what we have implemented so far in Waartaa:

- Realtime IRC client as a service
- Centralized logging
- 24x7 idling
- Mail notifications
- Intuitive UI

There are many people who use our demo instance at `https://try.waartaa.com
<https://try.waartaa.com>`_ or use a self hosted version. Waartaa made it to
Google Summer of Code 2014 as a project from Fedora. If everything goes well,
we are considering to implement Waartaa to empower IRC communications in the
community.
