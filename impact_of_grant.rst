Impact of grant
===============

We are excited and passionate about Waartaa. Waartaa has got loads of TODOs to
reach at a competitive level with the peer proprietary communication tools.
Nevertheless, Waartaa is not limited to be another clone for proprietary tools,
but it aims to go beyond that, to build a tool the people need, irrespective
of profit or loss. More the number of hands and hours to contribute to Waartaa,
the merrier.

Currently, we work on Waartaa whenever we find some free time off our work.
Sometimes, we work before office hours and sometimes after office hours, and
on weekends. Sometimes, there are blockers like extra work pressure at
office, personal issues, etc. We'd love to take a break from all distractions
and focus on Waartaa full time.

Our target is to improve waartaa as much as possible and as fast as possible.
And, we are ready for any possible scenario:

- If Waartaa does not make it, we continue our part time development. It may
  take some time, but we'd complete what we started.
- If one of us gets selected, one develops full time and the other
  does part time development (1X + 0.2X).
- If both gets selected, we both develop full time (1X + 1X).

If selected, this grant will help us in accelerating the development of Waartaa
and make it featureful and production ready at the earliest.
